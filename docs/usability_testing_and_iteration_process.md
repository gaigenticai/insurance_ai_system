# Usability Testing and Design Iteration Process

This document outlines the conceptual process for conducting usability testing sessions based on the `docs/usability_test_plan.md` and the subsequent analysis and design iteration phases for the configurable insurance platform.

## I. Conducting Usability Testing Sessions

This phase focuses on executing the usability tests with representative users to gather feedback on the interactive prototypes.

### 1. Recruitment

*   **Objective:** Recruit 3-5 participants for each defined persona (Sarah - Claims Processor, Maria - Institution Administrator, Tom - Actuarial Analyst).
*   **Sourcing Strategy:**
    *   **Internal Employees:** Identify employees from different departments (claims, underwriting, IT/operations, actuarial) within the development organization or a pilot client who match the persona criteria. This is often quicker and more cost-effective for initial rounds.
    *   **Existing Clients (Pilot Institutions):** If applicable, engage with users from institutions already part of a pilot program. This provides highly relevant feedback.
    *   **External Testers (via Agencies/Panels):** For broader or more unbiased feedback, use professional recruiting services that can find participants matching specific demographic and professional experience criteria. This is more common for later-stage testing but can be valuable for prototypes if budget allows.
*   **Screening:** Use a short screener questionnaire based on the recruitment criteria in the `usability_test_plan.md` to ensure participants are suitable.
*   **Scheduling & Incentives:** Schedule sessions at times convenient for participants. Offer appropriate incentives for their time (e.g., gift cards, honorarium).

### 2. Session Execution

Following the methodology outlined in `docs/usability_test_plan.md`:

*   **Pilot Testing:**
    *   Conduct 1-2 pilot sessions (e.g., with internal team members not directly involved in the design) to refine the moderator script, test the prototype's functionality and flow, and check recording/conferencing tools.
    *   Adjust tasks or script based on pilot feedback.
*   **Moderation:**
    *   A designated moderator will lead each session.
    *   The moderator will strictly follow the script:
        *   **Introduction & Consent:** Welcome, explain purpose, assure confidentiality, obtain recording consent, explain think-aloud.
        *   **Pre-test Questionnaire:** Administer if not done beforehand.
        *   **Task Presentation:** Present each task clearly, one at a time, based on the persona's scenario.
        *   **Observation & Probing:** Encourage participants to "think aloud." Use open-ended, non-leading questions to clarify user actions or comments (e.g., "What are you expecting to happen here?", "Can you tell me more about why that was confusing?"). Avoid helping the user unless they are completely stuck and it's necessary to move to the next task.
        *   **Post-test Interview & Questionnaire:** Administer SUS or other satisfaction measures. Ask open-ended questions for overall feedback.
        *   **Wrap-up:** Thank the participant.
*   **Observation & Note-Taking:**
    *   At least one dedicated observer (besides the moderator) should take detailed notes.
    *   Notes should capture:
        *   User quotes (verbatim where possible).
        *   Observed behaviors (hesitations, errors, navigation paths, facial expressions if visible).
        *   Task completion success/failure and time taken (approximate).
        *   Specific UI elements causing confusion or delight.
        *   Technical issues encountered with the prototype or testing tools.
*   **Data Collection:**
    *   Video and audio recordings of sessions (with consent).
    *   Moderator and observer notes.
    *   Completed pre-test and post-test questionnaires (including SUS scores).
    *   Screenshots or short video clips of critical incidents.

### 3. Data Management

*   **Organization:** Create a structured repository for all testing data.
    *   Folders for each participant, containing their recording, notes, and questionnaire responses.
    *   A master spreadsheet or database to log participant details, session dates, and key quantitative metrics (task completion, SUS scores).
*   **Anonymization:** Ensure participant data is anonymized in reports and discussions outside the core research team if required.
*   **Backup:** Regularly back up all collected data.

## II. Analyzing Feedback and Iterating on Design

This phase focuses on making sense of the collected data and translating it into actionable design improvements.

### 1. Debrief and Data Consolidation

*   **Immediate Post-Session Debrief:** Moderator and observer(s) should have a brief debrief immediately after each session to capture fresh impressions and key takeaways.
*   **Data Transcription/Summarization:** Transcribe key parts of recordings or summarize detailed notes for easier analysis.
*   **Centralized Data Repository:** Consolidate all notes, questionnaire data, and key observations into a central location (e.g., a shared document, spreadsheet, or dedicated research tool).

### 2. Affinity Mapping / Thematic Analysis

*   **Process:**
    1.  Extract individual observations, quotes, pain points, and positive comments onto virtual or physical sticky notes.
    2.  The team collaboratively groups these notes based on similarity or themes (e.g., "Navigation Issues," "Form Clarity," "AI Insight Usefulness," "Workflow Confusion").
    3.  Name these thematic groups.
*   **Output:** A clear visualization of common patterns, recurring issues, and areas of user satisfaction or frustration across all participants.

### 3. Prioritization of Issues

*   **Classification:** Classify identified usability issues based on:
    *   **Severity:**
        *   **Critical:** Prevents task completion; user is completely blocked.
        *   **Major:** Causes significant frustration or inefficiency; user may find a workaround but with difficulty.
        *   **Minor:** Causes slight irritation or inefficiency but does not prevent task completion.
        *   **Cosmetic/Suggestion:** User suggestion or minor aesthetic issue.
    *   **Frequency:** How many participants encountered the issue?
    *   **Impact on Key Goals:** How much does this issue hinder the persona from achieving their primary goals?
*   **Prioritization Matrix:** Use a simple matrix (e.g., Severity vs. Frequency) to prioritize which issues to address first. Critical and Major issues with high frequency are top priority.

### 4. Brainstorming Solutions

*   For each high-priority issue, the design and product team will brainstorm potential solutions.
*   Consider alternative UI approaches, clearer labeling, improved information hierarchy, or changes to the interaction flow.
*   Refer back to UI/UX principles and competitive analysis for inspiration.

### 5. Design Iteration

*   **Update High-Fidelity Mockups:**
    *   Based on the brainstormed solutions, the UX/UI designer will revise the high-fidelity mockups.
    *   The `docs/high_fidelity_mockups_description.md` document would be conceptually updated to reflect these changes, noting the rationale based on usability findings.
*   **Update Interactive Prototypes:**
    *   The interactive prototype(s) will be updated to incorporate the prioritized design changes.
    *   The scope of changes will be reflected in revisions or addendums to `docs/interactive_prototypes_scope.md` if significant.

### 6. Creating a Usability Test Findings Report

This report summarizes the testing process and outcomes for stakeholders.

*   **Template (`docs/usability_test_findings_report_template.md`):**

    ```

### 7. Decision on Further Testing

*   Based on the severity and number of issues found, and the extent of the design changes made:
    *   **Minor Issues:** May not require immediate re-testing; can be validated in subsequent development sprints or a later, more comprehensive test.
    *   **Major/Critical Issues:** Warrant a follow-up round of usability testing on the iterated prototype, focusing specifically on the areas that were problematic. This ensures that the design changes have effectively addressed the issues without introducing new ones.
*   The iteration cycle (Test -> Analyze -> Design -> Retest) continues until the core user flows meet usability goals.

This systematic approach ensures that user feedback is actively incorporated into the design process, leading to a more usable, efficient, and satisfying configurable insurance platform.
