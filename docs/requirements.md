# Insurance AI System - Production-Grade Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for a fully modular, production-grade Agentic AI system for the insurance industry.

## System Requirements

- Zero placeholder logic
- No hardcoded parameters or dummy values
- No TODOs or stub agents
- Every module must be fully functional with production-grade logic and clearly defined inputs/outputs
- All logic must be institution-configurable via an external config agent
- The system should be Dockerizable and deployable with one click (e.g., via Railway)

## Modules

### Module 1: Underwriting (Autonomous Risk Evaluation)

- Accepts structured and unstructured input (form data + uploaded PDFs/images)
- Uses OCR and NLP to extract, validate, and normalize applicant data
- Dynamically assesses risk based on institution-specific rules and external context
- Requests missing information proactively if needed
- Outputs a final underwriting decision: **Approve**, **Deny**, or **Modify Terms**
- Logs all decisions and rationale for audit
- Learns from past outcomes and feedback to improve future scoring

**Agents Required:**
- `ApplicantIntakeAgent`
- `DocumentOCRAgent`
- `RiskScoringAgent`
- `AdaptiveQuestioningAgent`
- `FeedbackTrainerAgent`
- `ConfigAgent`

### Module 2: Claims Automation (Fast, Ethical Resolution)

- Ingests structured claims via API or webhook
- Triages by type and severity using real rules
- Validates claim eligibility by fetching policy data
- Settles low-value claims autonomously based on config thresholds
- Escalates complex or suspicious claims to humans, with rationale
- Detects potential fraud patterns without false positives
- Logs all steps for regulatory compliance
- Communicates transparently with the end customer

**Agents Required:**
- `ClaimTriageAgent`
- `PolicyVerifierAgent`
- `AutoResolutionAgent`
- `EscalationAgent`
- `FraudDetectorAgent`
- `EthicsLoggerAgent`
- `ConfigAgent`

### Module 3: Actuarial Analysis and Reporting (Data-Driven Decisions)

- Ingest BU-specific financial, policy, and claims data
- Detect trends, anomalies, and fraud indicators using real statistical or ML techniques
- Compare internal BU performance to market benchmarks
- Generate executive and detailed reports (in PDF, JSON, and Markdown formats)
- Support drill-down capability by geography, product, customer cohort
- Include fraud insights and financial forecasting in final outputs

**Agents Required:**
- `DataNormalizerAgent`
- `TrendAnalyzerAgent`
- `BenchmarkComparisonAgent`
- `ReportGeneratorAgent`
- `FraudAnalysisAgent`
- `ConfigAgent`

## System-Wide Configuration and Branding

Every module must:
- Be configurable on a per-institution basis using a central `ConfigAgent`
- Support external JSON, database, or API-backed configuration
- Include branding configuration: name, logo URL, email templates, report design style
- Respect language/localization settings (if configured)

## Deployment Requirements

The final system must:
- Be modular and production-ready
- Be Docker-compatible (no dev-only paths)
- Can be deployed via Railway with a single command
- Has no dummy data or commented placeholders
- Includes real validation for inputs and outputs
- Produces audit logs for all agent decisions
